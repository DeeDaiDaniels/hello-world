# hello-world
Problem with my git password:
So many passwords here and there, They are very hard for me to keep track the most updated ones.
Here is the place where I am going to do version control and inventory control to record all of the evolution of my passwords' modification dates and corresponding password values, what about hash them so that nobody can see the actual values except me and my local machines along with remote machines?
